She has published 150+ papers in premier international journals and conferences.\n\n* The rapid advancements in AI, particularly with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their diverse applications, have attracted huge global interest and raised significant concerns on responsible AI and AI safety. While LLMs are impressive examples of AI models, it is the compound AI systems, which integrate these models with other key components for functionality and quality/risk control, that are ultimately deployed and have real-world impact.\n\n* These AI systems, especially autonomous LLM agents and those involving multi-agent interacting, require system-level engineering to ensure responsible AI and AI safety. In this talk, Dr Lu will introduce a responsible AI engineering approach to address system-level responsible AI challenges. This includes engineering/governance methods, practices, tools, and platforms to ensure responsible AI and AI safety.\n\nThanks\nVincent Koc\nDeepLearning.AI Ambassador"), ('Buying Businesses - Week 2 - Business Acquisition Strategies', 'Australian Business Buyers Community', datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 15, 19, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=36000))), datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 15, 19, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=36000))), None, "Join us for Week 2 of our 12 Week Series;\n\n**How to Raise Money, Buy Businesses & Manage A Portfolio of Companies**\n\nYour host; Brandon Lipman, will present an interactive workshop on;\n\n**Business Acquisition Strategies**\n\nKey Areas that will be covered:\n\n* *Sector/Industry Targeting*\n* *Developing a Thesis*\n* *Optimising for Cash on Cash Returns*\n* *Roll Up/Group Building Strategies*\n* *Buy-Build-Sell Strategies*\n* *Growth Through Acquisition*\n* *Joint Exit*\n* *Sweat Equity*\n\nSMB (Small & Medium Business Buying) is a topic heavily covered overseas - but (as per usual) Australia seems to lack its own community.\n\nNo matter whether or not;\n\n* Buying businesses is a new concept to you\n* You've been looking at businesses for a while\n* You've bought 1 or 10 businesses\n\nWe can guarantee you that this will be the group and event to join & be a part of.\n\nYou do not need to have attended any of the previous workshops in order to attend this one.
